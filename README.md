# tho's light

## introduction

Tho's Light is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that, by default, places content centrally with a simple sidebar to the left and (for posts) a clickable table of contents fixed to the right.

If the screen is narrow (i.e. viewing on a phone) then content is re-stacked vertically for easier reading.

Tho's Light was developed specifically for [In Pursuit of his Own Hat](https://inpursuitofhisownhat.github.io). 

## github pages

Tho's Light is compatible with GitHub Pages, it only uses the pagination jekyll plugin.

## give it a go

To try it, simply clone the repo and run `jekll serve` to view locally.

You will need the jekyll-paginate plugin to be installed: `gem install jekyll-paginate`
